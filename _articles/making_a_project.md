`Projects` in Synapse are "containers" that groups relevant content and people together. Researchers using Synapse can work in private or collaborate in groups. Some users share their research across large consortia. Projects support the following:

* **Organize Your Work**: With Synapse you can organize the parts in your workflow (data, code, etc) into a hierarchy like a file system. With the tabs across the top of each project, you can easily navigate to your [Wikis](wikis.md), [Files and Folders](files_and_versioning.md), SQL-based [Tables](tables.md), and even conduct conversations using [Discussion Forums](discussion.md).

* **Store Data, Code, and Results**: You can upload your data, code, and results to Synapse, or store a reference to their location in your local computer system or on the web. Everything can be stored as Files, hosted by Synapse, in your own external cloud storage, or using [Docker Containers](http://docs.synapse.org/articles/docker.html).

* **Control Access or Release Your Work Publicly**: You have complete control over how users and groups can interact with your work. Work privately, openly, or somewhere in between.

* **Link and share content with others**: Just as you can control the access to your work, projects can serve as a platform for linking and sharing your work with others.

* **Custom, Searchable Annotations**: Assign any key/value pair you want. Those values become searchable and available to those granted access.

* **Attach Figures and Documents**: Upload documents and images via the website or programmatically.

* **Create Multiple Projects**: If you are working on unrelated works, you can create multiple projects. Each project can be tailored to a specific workflow, using only the features needed for the project.
